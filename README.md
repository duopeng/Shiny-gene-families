## A Shiny app that visualizes clusters of gene family members based on genetic distance
### Multi-dimensional scaling is used to map genes onto a two-dimensional plot

### Instructions
Open one of the app.R files in Rstudio and hit the "run app" button

### Folder Structure:
```

├── ts                    # ts only, Brazil A4 and Y C6 (k-tuple distance)
├── ts_fullAlnDist        # ts only, Brazil A4 and Y C6 (full-alignment distance)
├── ts_fullAlnDist_v2     # ts only, Brazil A4 and Y C6 (refined full-alignment distance)
